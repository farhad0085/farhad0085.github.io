# Data Visualization and API Integration - ChartJS

The project was basically about fetching data from an API endpoint and then visualizing that data in the webpage.

There was a response from the API and it contains results. Now the data available in results have to be shown in the webpage. Also there is a filter option available in the sidebar. When the user applies some filters itâ€™ll visualize according to that filter even without reloading the page. When any one of the bars is clicked, all relevant data for that bar (Section) is shown in the box below the chart.

The stack used here is Chart.JS and pure JavaScript. Every code block written was fully reusable.
